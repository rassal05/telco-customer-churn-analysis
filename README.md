# 📊 Telco Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

Welcome to my **first end-to-end data analytics project**, where I explore customer churn patterns using Python and visual storytelling. This project is a milestone in my journey to becoming a data analyst. It showcases my ability to clean data, perform exploratory analysis, extract insights, and craft a compelling dashboard using only **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**.
